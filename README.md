#Presentation

##Introduction

For the last two years, we've been hearing a lot about **ES6**. For the last few months, more and more people have started to embrace it, with the help of tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Now, it's just here and we should use it.

New tools come to help us at this task. One of them is [jspm](http://jspm.io/) (a package manager for the SystemJS universal loader).

* No more bower, no more browserify or webpack
* You can use any type of module (ES6, AMD, CommonJS ...)
* You can install those modules from npm, github, bower (almost anywhere in fact)
* You still have plugins that will let you require css, html or whatever ...

It's used by default in [aurelia.io](http://aurelia.io/).

*Note* : There are a lot of yeoman generators using bower or others with production-ready workflows, for most of the frameworks but I couldn't find some for angular 1.x with ES6 and jspm.

**TL;DR** : I'm gonna make my own angular/ES6/jspm stack.

##Endgoal

The endgoal is to have a fully functionnal workflow for angular 1.x, using ES6+ and jspm, with the following features :

* Development server with livereload
* Sass
* ES6+ debugging (sourcemaps)
* Production build
* Unit Tests
* jshint
* Angular written ES6 style
	* ngInject
	* use ES7 decorators ? (not so sure about that) [ยน](#footnotes)
* ...

##Roadmap

I will make a first version **without any angular code**, only a simple project with enough code base in ES6 to get to challenge jspm, this will be the versions tagged **v0.x**.

Once this done, I'll get to the next level : add angular. This will be the versions **v1.x**

See the [Releases section](https://github.com/topheman/angular-es6-jspm/releases) for more informations.

#Instructions

##Requirements

* node/npm
* gulp
* jspm (latest : `0.16.0-beta.3`) - `npm install -g jspm@beta`
* sass

##Install

`npm install` (it will automatically trigger the `jspm install` at `postinstall`)

##Launch

* `gulp serve` : will launch a dev server

##Build

###To build the whole site

Simple `gulp build` : a version ready for distribution will be available in `build/dist` :

* the ES6 files are transpiled to ES5, concateneted in a single js file and a link to this file is added in the `index.html`. (minification and other optimisations aren't yet available)
* the sass files are compiled to css (not yet minified)
* assets such as images are copied to the distribution folder

*NB: There is still work to do on the build part : such as env based builds, minifications, make sure all assets are available ...*

###To build only the js part with the jspm cli

`jspm bundle-sfx app/bootstrap ./.tmp/scripts/app.bootstrap.build.js`

##Deployment

###On github pages

You can host your project on github pages like this ([source](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/)), pushing to the github pages the `dist` folder where the project is built.

```shell
$ gulp build
$ cd build/dist
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/angular-es6-jspm
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages
$ gulp build
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first push to production"
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
```

Wait a couple of minutes and go to your [own github pages](http://topheman.github.io/angular-es6-jspm/) ...

Next time, you'll only have to do the last 4 steps ...

###Resources

Among all the posts/videos I read, here are a few ones that I recommend :

* [How to start writing apps with ES6, Angular 1.x and JSPM](http://martinmicunda.com/2015/02/09/how-to-start-writing-apps-with-es6-angular-1x-and-jspm/) by [@martinmicunda](https://github.com/martinmicunda) that I thank here for his post and sharing his code
* [jspm.io](http://jspm.io/) - watch the videos to better understand what it is about

*Previous personal projects on ES6*

* [topheman/react-es6](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6)
* [topheman/react-es6-isomorphic](https://github.com/topheman/react-es6-isomorphic)

###Reminder

This part is only to keep track of some infos that may not be relevant anymore since jspm evolves fast, but might help me or other people in the long run.

####About jspm

A major update has been done for the v0.17.0, so to be working with the versions to be, I've upgraded jspm :

* upgrade jspm to the current latest 0.18.2 - major upgrade was [v0.17.0](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/releases/tag/0.17.0)
* upgrade [jspm-cli to the latest beta](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/releases/tag/0.16.0-beta) (so that it would be in sync) :
	* `npm install -g jspm@beta`
	* `jspm init`
	* `jspm install`
	* note : I restarted with a blank config (it became much thiner)

###Footnotes

1. There are decorators in Angular 2, but since they changed a lot of concepts, it might be misleading for a team-members (more over, I've seen multiple people implementing them, not one uses them the same way). I may change of advice in time ...
